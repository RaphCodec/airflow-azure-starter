# Minimal Redis config for Flask-Limiter rate limiting running in docker-compose
# (no password, only in docker-compose network)
# Adjust memory limits as needed based on expected load

# Memory: 64MB is more than enough for rate limiting keys
# Assuming a few KB per user for small DE team of 20 or so users
maxmemory 64mb

# Persistence: disable if you only need rate limiting (keys can be lost on restart)
