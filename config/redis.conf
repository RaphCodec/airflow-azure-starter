# Minimal Redis config for Flask-Limiter rate limiting running in docker-compose
# (no password, only in docker-compose network)
# Adjust memory limits as needed based on expected load
bind 0.0.0.0
port 6379

# Memory: 64MB is more than enough for rate limiting keys
# Assuming a few KB per user for small DE team of 20 or so users
maxmemory 64mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Persistence: disable if you only need rate limiting (keys can be lost on restart)
save ""
appendonly no

# Networking: only allow connections from your trusted network
protected-mode yes

# Security (optional, since Redis is only in docker-compose network)
# requirepass yourStrongPasswordHere

# Performance tweaks for small instance
databases 1        # Only one logical DB needed
tcp-keepalive 60   # Keep connections alive
